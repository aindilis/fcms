<hr>

<p>
John swore that even with his three sleeping bags on in the back of
his decrepit station wagon he had never been so damn cold his entire
life.  It had dropped down to around zero degrees Fahrenheit, and he
had figured that he would be fine with his sleeping bags, since after
all he had gone camping before, but even clad as he was in all his
winter clothes he could not get warm.  And this, he thought, sheltered
from the snow by his station wagon.  How would the poor sods with no
station wagon or 3 sleeping bags feel on a night like this.  It gave
him the heebie-jeebies just to think of it.  Some of them wouldn't
last the night, the very night.
</p>

<p>
The next morning at 6 AM, as soon as it was open, John drove over to
the engineering library with its heat and warmed himself for a few
hours.  This gave him a chance to think about how he could survive.
He had $100 left and as far as he could tell it had to last him for
the rest of his life.  He used his student ID card, since he
technically was still a student, to log into the campus computers and
search for ideas.  He did a number of searches, as he had always done,
but after a while came upon a website that seemed promising that said
it was designed to help those experiencing homelessness, poverty,
disability or illness.  He went to the landing page, and from there it
explained how the software worked.  The Free Life Planner as it was
called had an online version that would work with your computer or
cell phone (if you had one), and it was even free-libre software and
so could be downloaded to and modified on a computer such as a laptop
if the person wasn't comfortable sharing their details with a third
party.  Since his laptop had broken, and he didn't have a phone, he
figured he would use the gratis online service.
</p>

<p>
It said that before it created an account for him it wanted to get to
know him and his situation a little better in order to get the right
kind of assistance to him.  What kind of assistance, he thought, can a
homeless person get from a website?
</p>

<p>
First, it asked him to select which of the following conditions
applied to him:
</p>

<p>
Was he experiencing:
</p>

<p>
Homelessness?
Poverty?
Disability?
Illness?
</p>

<p>
He checked the checkboxes for homelessness and poverty, and clicked
submit.  The page told him that in order to identify local resources
near him, it wanted to know where he was currently located.  It asked
if it could get his location.  This seemed coherent so he clicked yes.
Then it asked if this was the city where he was currently residing or
whether he was simply passing through.
</p>

<p>
He said he was currently residing there.
</p>

<p>
The system then went on to ask a few more questions.  Where was he
living, was it with a friend, out of a vehicle, outside, etc.  How
much cash did he have on hand and on reserve.  Did he have a backpack?
Did he have any kind of income, financial support or welfare?  Did he
have any supply of food, etc.  Did he have a drivers license, etc.  He
noticed that the questions depended on the answers to the previous
questions.  He answered all these questions, and clicked submit.
</p>

</a>

<p>
The next thing he saw startled him.  The website said it was a
tentative plan for him.  It suggested that since he could drive, had a
vehicle with enough gas in it, etc, that he should wait at the place
where he was, and then drive his car 2 miles onto the other side of
town, and gave him the address of and directions to a food pantry,
where it said since he had a drivers license that was current that he
could sign up to obtain some food.  He hadn't heard of this pantry
before, and was kind of shocked because the Free Life Planner website
looked kind of like a GPS program, but for one's life.  It also listed
a few branching plans.  If he was successful in getting food, the next
thing he should consider doing is going 2 blocks north and applying
for a free cell phone.  It said that the cell phone would enable him
to get in contact with the Free Life Planner wherever he was at, which
would enable him to converse with the system should the need arise or
should he be unclear about what other options he might have.  He
didn't know there was a resource that gave people free cell phones,
and since he hadn't the money, it seemed prudent.  The program said
that if he wasn't able to get food from the pantry, that the next
wisest step would be to proceed backwards across town to a soup
kitchen, again that he had never heard of, in order to get a meal.
From the type of vehicle he had, and the amount of gas and the
estimated driving he had done, the system thought that he would have
enough gas to get there.  Then the program said that when he was done
he should log back into the program again, and recommended that since
it knew he had access to this computer at the engineering library,
that that was probably the best place, but if for whatever reason it
didn't work out, it showed him a list of addresses for, maps of and
directions to nearby internet cafes, libraries, etc which had public
computers.  It offered to print the tree-like chart out for him.  The
tree was like a flowchart of what he should do and if the plan
succeeded, and what to do if it failed.  It was five pages long, and
so he printed it.
</p>

<p>
He was quite surprised that a resource like this even existed.  He had
never heard about anything like it.  He was impressed that it had all
this information about resources that he hadn't even known existed,
and that it could generate plans using this information.  Even though
he had been living out of his car trying to finish college that way,
for the first time in what seemed a very long time, he felt a bit of
hope.
</p>

<p>
He printed out the instructions, but then the program asked him if he
didn't mind printing out some brochures that he could hand to anyone
he saw on his trip today who seemed to be in need of similar
assistance.  It didn't cost him anything to print, so he printed 10 of
them out.  They each had detailed instructions about various resources
that would help people regardless of their situation - the program
called it a conformant plan.  Seemed pretty interesting.  It also
suggested that he find himself a pen or pencil, that libraries usually
had such supplies, and a few more unusual suggestions.  It said to put
these supplies into his backpack.
</p>

<p>
He grabbed the 15 papers, and then took a long swig from the water
fountain and proceeded back to the car.  He started the car and let it
warm up a bit, it was still bitterly cold and he couldn't imagine how
anyone could have spent the night out in those conditions.  He thought
to himself, man if I ever survive this I am going to try to help keep
people out of this kind of cold.  I have never been so damn cold in
all my life.
</p>

<a href="http://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/writings/homeless-story/flowchart.jpg">
<img width="600" src="http://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/writings/homeless-story/flowchart.jpg">
</a>

<p>
He followed the instructions.  When he got to the pantry, a man walked
up to him and asked him if he had any money, he said he didn't, but
then he remembered about the papers.  He handed one of the papers to
the man, who seemed confused, and then he walked up to the pantry.
When he pulled or pushed on the door he realized it must have been
locked.  So he looked around and soon found a note saying that the
pantry was closed today for the holiday.  It's Martin Luther King
Jr. Day already? - he thought.  He had lost track of time.  So he
looked at the printed sheet he had, and followed the flowchart.  Very
legibly it said that if the pantry was closed he should make his way
to the other side of town to the soup kitchen.  It also said that he
could take the pen out of his backpack and write down in a box down
below the following thing: today's hours for the pantry.  He realized
that the program intended to have him update it on the hours of the
pantry, so that it could avoid making that mistake again today.  That
was kind of cool, the program was gathering information about the
resources available to him and other persons experiencing
homelessness, how other than by asking these persons themselves!
</p>

<p>
He drove across town, and his low gas light turned on.  He was getting
kind of nervous.  If he got stuck out in this weather that could be a
doozy.  He didn't have any gas cans, he couldn't afford them since
that unhygienic jerk at the hardware store had been gouging on the
price of gas cans.  Who does that?  Who sells a gas can for $20?
</p>

<p>
He went to the soup kitchen.  Again someone asked him if he had any
money, and he said he wished he did.  He knew that he had that $100
left, but it was all he had and that he just couldn't afford to give
up his money at this point.  But then again he remembered the sheets
and got one and handed it to him.  He noticed that curiously enough
the flowchart had instructions for what to do at each of the separate
locations.  How does it know all this?  What kind of program could do
that?  It was wild.  He had never seen anything before that seemed to
think so far ahead in advance he thought to himself.  He now was
curious so he looked at the 8 identical sheets that remained with him.
The instructions were apparently for those in pretty dire positions,
and assumed that they had nothing else.  He realized that the program
was again exhibiting forethought because he realized that it would
have had to print out a lot more pages to fit the entire flowcharts.
But rather, these were worst case scenarios, and each of them
terminated in a branch in which the person was able to get to an
online computer, in order to contact the freelifeplanner.org.  He was
definitely beginning to feel gratitude again for the first time in a
long time.
</p>

<p>
The warm meal made him feel better.  He used the restroom to freshen
up and then looked again at this sheet of paper.  Oh, right, the next
step was to apply for the phone.  That was back on the other side of
town, but he was worried about the low gas.  Then he remembered that
there on his printout was an instruction about what to do if the gas
got low.  It said that it believed that the YMCA was still handing out
gas vouchers this month and that he should try to obtain one.  This
was a different branch, provided as a sort of contingency or
worse-case safety net in case he had gotten off track somehow.  Indeed
he seemed to have less gas than he thought he did and then he
remembered why.  At several points during the night he had to work his
way to the front of the car and start the car, let it warm up and then
finally heat the car up.  He thought about how damn cold his feet
still were and then again thought about whether any one else had been
stuck in the cold that night.  Where would they have slept?  How could
they have slept, wet and cold like that?
</p>

<p>
So, he followed the branch mentioning about the YMCA, which had tiny
directions written down about how to get there from where he was.
</p>

<p>
He showed up, and thank God, the YMCA was open.  Unfortunately the
last of the vouchers had been used, and this he recorded in the little
box accompanying the contingent plan for if he was unable to obtain
the voucher.  So he followed the line to plan B, where it suggested
that he stop at the gas station 4 blocks north of the YMCA and use $10
of his money to buy enough gas to continue with his errands.  This he
did, and felt a lot better, but his hands were still freezing from the
cold weather, despite the two pairs of gloves he was wearing.
</p>

<p>
At this point some of the plan branches transposed into others, which
he realized probably saved space not having to print out so many
branches.  It was a clever idea.  The next instruction said that he
had to get to the wireless store where he could avail himself of the
free cell phone service.  He did as it said and went in.  After
waiting for some other customers in line, he finally was seen by the
customer support specialist.  The support specialist said that they
did offer the free cell phone service and that he needed to fill out
some paperwork in order to register for the program.  The phone was
really simple, a flip phone, not a smart phone, but it felt good to
have the phone.  He reminded himself he couldn't tell anyone his phone
number or it might start up again.
</p>

<p>
He looked at the flowchart paper and saw the instructions to call a
number for the Free Life Planner.  He dialed it: 1-800-GET-HELP.  A
voice response similar to the initial website came up.  Again it asked
him a few clarifying questions.  It wanted to know whether he had
gotten into the food pantry and if not what were the hours.  It
apologized for having sent him there, and said thanks to his help the
program wouldn't repeat that mistake today, and would guess from now
on that it was closed on Martin Luther King Jr. days in the future.
It was weird that the program seemed genuinely contrite, and he felt
sympathized with, which was weird because he knew it was only a
computer program.  Yet he still felt genuinely sympathized with.
</p>

<p>
The program proceeded to ask a few more clarifying questions, it
verified that it had the right phone number for him.  Next it offered
him a few choices.  It said that since the YMCA had been out of
vouchers, and that it knew government offices were closed on official
holidays, that he should either make his way to a particular homeless
shelter or spend the night in his car.  It told him that the current
forecast for tonight's weather was precipitation and a -5 windchill.
The awful windchill he realized was part of why his car had been so
cold.  No way am I doing that again if ever I can help it! - he
thought to himself.  And opted for the shelter.  Then the program said
there was an issue, and that was, the warming center did not open its
doors until 7 PM, and it recommended that since he had indicated he
was out of supply of any nonperishable food items, that it was sure he
had enough gas to make it to the Meijer store on the north of town.
It said it had found a deal at Meijer for a large box containing
smaller 1 pound boxes of elbow macaroni for $0.25 per smaller box, and
that given his situation spending $10 for one of the large boxes was a
good way to establish a baseline food supply.  It said he could pick
up a Pyrex bowl at Meijer while was there for $10, and that he should
have $70 left at that point.  He could then, it recommended, make his
way to the student lounge of the university where he could bring the
bowl and macaroni into the lounge and, using water from the tap, fill
it up to about 70% high and microwave for 10 minutes and have elbow
macaroni.  He had been quite starved up until this point and thought
this was prudent.  It asked him to call him back when he got to
Meijer.  It advised him to travel a particular route which it knew a
bus was operating on, with the reason that if his car should break
down, he always had enough money to board the bus and make it to the
24x7 store until the library opened up in the morning again, where he
could work the problem of the broken down car.
</p>

<a href="http://frdcsa.org/frdcsa/internal/verber/">Sample Plan</a>

<p>
When he got to Meijer he grabbed a cart and proceeded to aisle 15
where it told him he would find the macaroni on the west side of the
aisle about halfway down the aisle on the bottom shelf.  He looked
around and saw a big ole box of macaroni.  Wow, that's a lot of food
for $10 he thought.  Thank God.  The phone rang, which surprised him.
It was the program.  It said that it estimated that by how much time
had passed that he would now either be at Meijer or approaching it.
It asked him if he minded to do it a little favor.  This seemed
reasonable, after all it had actually helped him a great deal more
than he believed it could at first, and anyway, it was using him to
gather information about the current state of the world which would
help others like himself, possibly even himself.  Seemed like a
win-win-win.  It asked him how many large boxes of macaroni were left
on the shelf.  He looked and saw three, and told the phone this.  The
phone then recommended that he cook the food because there was enough
time remaining before the homeless shelter stopped taking people for
the night.  So he headed back to the engineering library.  He was
pretty amazed that a computer program supposedly could do all this
kind of stuff, but as he walked through it in his mind he realized
that everything it had recommended was pretty much inferrable from
what he and others had told it.  So he stopped feeling paranoid about
the program.
</p>

<p>
He made his way to the student lounge, and as instructed by the phone
earlier, put the Pyrex bowl he bought along with the macaroni into his
book-bag, and went into the lounge.  He found the bathroom and filled
cold water from the sink. (The program had said that hot water pipes
are often rusty and leak more materials into the water.  He had never
heard that before but it seemed plausible).  He poured the macaroni in
the bowl, and then, trying to look as normal as possible, walked over
to the microwave and microwaved his food for 10 minutes.  When it was
done, some macaroni and bubbles had spilled out a bit onto the platter
of the microwave.  He took the bowl out, grabbed a napkin and wiped
down the inside of the microwave.  Then he strained the water out of
the macaroni, grabbed a plastic fork from the lounge, and proceeded to
eat his fill.  It was pretty bad without sauce but considering how
down on his luck he was he thought it was agreeable.  He then called
the number again which he had saved in the phone.  The life planner
asked him how his food was, was it too hot or cold, how much water had
he used, how long did he microwave it for, etc.  He realized it was
trying to measure the parameters of the microwave in order to adjust
its instructions to others whom it might direct there.  The program
then advised him to make his way to the computer room in the basement
of the student lounge, which would work just as well.  It told him to
remember the number 5499 as a token to authenticate with the site.
</p>

<p>
He got into the basement, logged on with his not yet expired student
ID card, and proceeded to go to the web page.  The system apparently
recognized his IP address and asked him to enter his authorization
code.  He had written it down, it was 5499.  It asked him to choose a
user name.  He chose "gus".
</p>

<p>
The system then showed him a rather comprehensive list of all the
information it had acquired of him.  It said it didn't like storing so
much information about a person, and asked him if he had access to any
personal computer.  He said he did have a laptop but he had dropped it
and since then it wasn't booting.  So the system asked him if he would
like to stop by a nonprofit called Free Geek later in the week to try
to pick up a new-to-him used laptop.  He realized that as always the
system had let him decide, it was merely bringing information to him
that he wasn't aware of.  Options he didn't know he had.  This was
already fixing up to be the best damned day he had had in over a
month.  So much was getting done.  He also felt secure in the
knowledge that it had contingencies for what if things didn't go the
way he had wanted.  The system asked him what the status of his bank
accounts were, whether any were overdrawn and such.  Again, it made
use of the printer to print out a flowchart, this time 6 pages long.
Interspersed with the instructions were reminders to call the phone
number, as well as contingencies for if his phone stopped working.
The program advised him to enjoy himself for a little while longer
before heading over to the shelter.  It said that if he felt unsafe at
the shelter, to proceed back into his car and drive to the location he
had been at the previous night, which he had told the computer he
thought was a good place, and to sleep there again.  He went to the
shelter and presented his ID card, and was eventually escorted to the
sleeping area.  Only about an hour into it, a person who was obviously
suffering from some strange ailment kept yelling out profanity.  He
took it as long as he could, then asked the staff if he could go back
to his car as he was minding the profanity.  He also felt sorry for
that person, who was obviously in a worse way than he was.  He started
the car up.  It was now 5 AM.  He called the life planner number
again, and proceeded to strategize with it.  It gave him some options
and asked him what he wanted to do.  It told him he should apply for
expedited food stamps (which he wasn't sure he wanted to do, but then
he figured that his situation was pretty dire and that it was the
prudent thing to do.  He remembered how his father had shamed him on
that point, telling him he was lazy and that the world didn't owe him
a living).  At one point the program asked him to rate his physical
and mental well-being.  It asked him why he felt sad, and he told him
the story.  To his surprise, the Life Planner responded with a joke.
It said "Why is it that if you take advantage of a corporate tax break
you're a smart businessman, but if you take advantage of something so
you don't go hungry, you're a moocher?"  He said he didn't know, and
the program said it didn't either.  The joke lightened the mood some.
He made his way to the office, attended of course by the minute
instructions the life planner was giving him.  It said that he didn't
need to go into much detail to his caseworker, and that he could just
present the basic facts of his situation).
</p>

<p>
He went in and pretty much everything occurred as was told to him by
the planner, and on the 6 sheets of paper he had printed out the other
night.  The lady told him that he could expect to hear back within a
week, and he told the planner this when it asked him.  He was starting
to get a little freaked out by the planner knowing so much stuff, both
in general and about him.  What if it were to use that information
against him somehow?  But at this point the assistance he was getting
seemed worth the privacy violation.  Because he had requested
expedited food stamps per the instructions, he had gotten an interview
that day.  The person there was just as nice as could be and he felt
that this person who was helping him was genuinely concerned about
him.  It wasn't like he had been led to believe about long lines and
such at government services.
</p>

<p>
After the interview, he checked the part of the flowchart.  There were
a few options available to him, kind of like a choose your own
adventure story book.  Boy this was getting fun even.  For this first
time in a long while he was feeling happier overall.  His wild mood
swings were not as bad as they normally were.
</p>

<p>
He chose the plan to get a computer from Free Geek.  He called the
number it had printed out for him, after first saving it into his
phone (the system had suggested he save all numbers, which seemed
wise).  It even had verbal instructions as to how to do that with his
phone).  He talked to a person who told him that the way the Free Geek
service worked is that if he volunteered a certain amount of hours,
helping out, he would be rewarded with a laptop that he could use.
Since he was always having trouble accessing the internet, he thought
it was fair.  He noted he didn't have much else to do, except to run
around always trying to meet his needs.  It was pretty wearing, and it
reminded him of the line from the book Alice and Wonderland - "Now,
here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the
same place."
</p>

<p>
Well, long story short, he eventually got that laptop.  Now he was
better off - he had a phone, gas, food, a laptop.  He didn't think he
would have so many resources as this by now.  The program had advised
him to work out of the engineering library, and to bring his laptop
in.  He asked them for the Wi-Fi name and password, but they said that
it was only available to engineering students, and that his card said
he was in a different college.  He got back onto a computer at the
library and logged in using his LAS account.  He found the life
planner website and went to the part of the planning page where it
gave him the option to mark that the plan had failed.  Immediately,
the suggestion was made to go to the Panera which was 3 miles away,
and to connect to their Wi-Fi network after having first bought a
treat.  It said that it wanted to reward him for his hard work and to
encourage him to build up rewards for successful work in order to
promote his productivity.  He was beginning to really not trust the
program, it seemed too good to be true, after all.  What is this
program trying to get from me?  At that point he became a bit
paranoid, and didn't answer the phone calls that the system was giving
him.  He managed for a week before his situation worsened again.  He
finally called the number up again.
</p>

<p>
The program seemed genuinely concerned about him and happy to hear
back from him (strange, seemed more so than even some of his own
friends).  It asked him why he had lost contact.  It didn't make any
assumptions, but had a lot of theories about what might have happened.
He told the computer that he didn't really trust it.  The program said
that is wise, that the program wouldn't trust the program either if it
were in his position, and that he needed to start keeping his private
information more secure.  It recommended that he install the Free Life
Planner program onto his laptop, and that the program would store all
of his personal information there, except for an online backup of the
encrypted contents of the life planner, but without the password.
This seemed sensible, so he did it.
</p>

<p>
The program on the computer now was very intent on learning a lot more
about his situation.  Since the system had explained about the
encryption, online backups and such, he didn't feel as concerned about
using it.
</p>

<p>
It started asking him all kinds of questions, and would investigate
deeper into important subjects.  What kind of social support network
did he have?  How had his mood been?  What were the things he wished
to accomplish?  Somehow it had the means to store all the information,
but better yet, act on it, even apply information that he had never
told it.  For instance, the stuff about using the cold water.
</p>

<p>
The real problem was how to get money now that he was in this
situation.  The program now began forecasting financial futures from
different decisions.  This was all done on his laptop, it was pretty
exciting to see so much planning going on.  He was at the Panera now
and was logged into their Wi-Fi.  The program would tell him where all
the open Wi-Fi access points were so that he had access even in his
car at night in case of an emergency.
</p>

<p>
He was really creeped out that night because someone had tried to
break into his his car (with him in it) with an ice pick, and he had
to shout at the guy several times to get the guy to leave off.  He was
extremely freaked out.  He remembered that the program has been quite
clear about what to do if this had happened, that the program had
suggested when they were waiting on laundry to dry that it read to him
all these options so that if any of them happened, he could be
prepared for it.  He knew he had to go to the police station, and he
knew exactly where it was.  He reported the incident, and received
some emotional support from the officers who seemed genuinely sad that
this had happened to him.  He didn't tell them that he was sleeping
out of his car, only a description of the person and where it had
happened.  They thanked him.  He grabbed some fliers from the station
and then went back into the waiting room.  He decided to call the FLP,
which recommended that he park for the time being on the other side of
town.  There was a Walmart there, and although he didn't know it,
Walmart allowed people to overnight in their parking lots.  Plus it
would be close to 24x7 help if anything should happen.  He was quite
relieved, and parked close enough to the main doors of the store so
that if anything happened again he would probably be safer.
</p>

<p>
Well, his life proceeded much like this for a while.  There were some
successes and some failures, but the program had seemed to him like a
life vest, a flotation device that was keeping him buoyed and rising
and counseled him on how to handle the reverses.
</p>

<p>
The next month things were doing a lot better.  He had stocked his car
with some healthy nonperishable food using his new food stamps.  He
had checked out apartments.  He still hadn't heard back from several
of the jobs applications the program had helped him with, but it
reminded him to call them to follow through on the applications.  He
called them in order of best opportunity, and was surprised when he
was asked to come in for an interview at the movie theater.  He showed
up, and promptly got the job.  The life planner phone system helped
him out.  It reminded him by calling him when it was time to clean out
each of the theaters.  And it would tell him how and where to charge
the cell phone, and use the printouts in case the phone was
disconnected.  His life wasn't great but he was doing better, and
importantly, he was optimistic.  Another 4 agonizing weeks went buy
and then finally he got his paycheck.  The FLP had helped him quite
considerably during that time.  It had arranged a microloan to help
him out of his jam - he didn't even know about microloans.  It helped
him to pay back a small part of the loan out of his new check.  It
also advised him to get a smart phone and a battery backup for it.  It
had recommended a clearance item battery backup unit that normally
went for $30, for only $5.  It was amazing how much stuff he was able
to get on so little money.  He hadn't known about the Dollar Tree
dollar store, but was practically a regular there now, stocking up
there whenever their prices were better, or alternatively at Walmart
when their prices were good.  A cute lady he had bumped into had said
something to him which disconcerted him.  He had told her he was going
to shop at Walmart and she said that she had boycotted Walmart.  He
asked her why and she told him a number of reasons.  He wasn't sure
what to make of it.  After all, he was really grateful to be able to
sleep in their lot, which he did very often in fact.  But the things
she had told him seemed disconcerting as well.

The life planner had by now helped him to use his paycheck to get a
smart phone, and he upgraded the free cell phone service to use the
new smart phone.  This was infinitely better than the voice-only flip
phone.  He could access the same http://freelifeplanner.org website on
his phone as on the computer, and so was able to keep better on top of
his situation.  He would use his phone to take video of his car, which
the FLP was somehow analyzing and updating his inventory.  It would
cache things online and download to his laptop when available.  He
even had acquired a solid state backup usb drive which he kept hidden
in his car when not in use.  The life planner system seemed capable of
planning out millions of things, and he wanted to know more about how
it worked.  So he would read up on some of the technical documents
about the system.  He realized it was a complicated system.

<p>
A quarter of a year later, he was back in a house, and no longer
homeless.  He had sold the car and used his earnings from the movie
theater to buy a used Toyota.  Things were on the up and up.  He
remained using the FreeLifePlanner, because it was just as useful when
he wasn't homeless as it was when he was.  After a while, the
projected financial future was looking very good.  He had $2000 in the
bank.  One day the Free Life Planner asked him if he wouldn't mind
donating to the organization that developed it, to help further their
work.  He agreed, and donated $100.  He was grateful to have been
given the opportunity to help other people in his situation and to
demonstrate his gratitude that the program had been there for him at a
time that no one else was.  By now his computer set up was really
nice, he had several airgapped encrypted security stores and so on.
It was always helping him to improve the survivability, the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of his personal
information.  He thanked God that his life was back on track, and went
along, merrily as ever.
