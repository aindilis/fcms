%% (Search Engine Optimization for the website, so it's easy to find)

%% The Free Life Planner is designed to help everyone, but especially
%% those experiencing homelessness, poverty, disability or illness.

%% The Free Life Planner has an gratis online version (that will work
%% with your computer and/or cell phone (if you have one)).  It is even
%% Free-Libre Software, which means you have freedom to download it to a
%% computer (and modify it and share your modifications with others), for
%% instance if you aren't comfortable sharing your details with a third
%% party.

%% Before we create an account for you I'd like to get to know you and
%% your situation a little better in order to get the right kind of
%% assistance to you.

%% What kind of assistance, you may wonder, can a homeless person get
%% from a website?

%% First, please select which of the following conditions apply to you:

%% Are you experiencing:

%% Homelessness?

%% Poverty?

%% Disability?

%% Illness?

%% In order to identify local resources near you, I'd like to know where
%% you are currently located.  May I get your location?

%% Is this the place where you are currently residing or are you simply
%% passing through?


%% Let's go on to answer a few more questions.

%% Where are you living - is it with a friend, out of a vehicle, outside,
%% etc?

%% How much cash did you have on hand and on reserve?
 
%% Do you have a backpack?

%% Do you have any kind of income, financial support or welfare?

%% Do you have any supply of food, etc?

%% Do you have a driver's license, etc?

%% Submit


%% Generate tentative plan:


%% Can you drive a vehicle?

%% Is your driver's license current?

%% Do you have access to a vehicle?

%% Is it yours?

%% Is it nearby?

%% Does it have any gas in it?

%% Do you mind using your driver's license to sign up at a food pantry?

%% Was the food pantry open?

%% If not, do you know what it's hours were today / are coming up?

%% Were you successful in getting food from the food pantry?

%% Do you mind using some private ID registering for a free cellular flipphone?

%% Was the wireless carrier's store open?

%% If not, do you know what it's hours were today / are coming up?

%% Were you successful in getting a phone from the wireless carrier's store?

%% Has the phone been activated?

%% If not, do you know when you will have activated your phone?

%% Do you mind using your flipphone to call the Free Life Planner's 1-800
%% number to get more assistance?








%% Are you hungry now?

%% Do you have trouble finding food to eat on a daily basis?

%% Would you like to create one or more stockpiles of nonperishable food?


%% You can access the Free Life Planner using a flip phone or a smart
%% phone.

%% Do you want to sign up for a free cellular flip phone?


%% Since you can drive, have a vehicle with enough gas in it, etc, I
%% recommend that you wait at the place where you currently are, and then
%% drive the car 2 miles onto the other side of town to the food pantry.
%% The addresss of the food pantry is <ADDRESS>, and you can get to it
%% from your current location by following these directions: <DIRECTIONS>

%% Since you have a drivers license that is current you can sign up to obtain some food.


%% If you are successful in getting food, the next thing you should
%% consider doing is going 2 blocks north and applying for a free
%% cellular flip phone at Locust Wireless.  The cell phone would enable
%% you to get in contact with the Free Life Planner wherever you are at,
%% which would enable you to converse with the system should the need
%% arise or should you be unclear about what other options you might
%% have.

%% I'm not sure if you know of this, but there is a resource that gives
%% people free cellular flip phones, and since you don't have the money,
%% it seems prudent to get one.

%% If you aren't able to get food from the pantry, the next wisest step
%% would be to proceed backwards across town to a soup kitchen in order
%% to get a meal.  The soup kitchen is located at <ADDRESS>, and you can
%% get there from here by following these directions: <DIRECTIONS>

%% From the type of vehicle you have, and the amount of gas and the
%% estimated driving you have done, I think that you would have enough
%% gas to get there.

%% When you are done you should log back into the program again, and I
%% recommend that since I know you have access to this computer at the
%% engineering library, that that is probably the best place, but if for
%% whatever reason it doesn't work out, I am showing you a list of
%% addresses for, maps of and directions to nearby internet cafes,
%% libraries, etc which have public computers.

%% Would you like to print the tree-like chart out for you to keep?  The
%% tree is like a flowchart of what you should do, and what to do if each
%% step of the plan succeeds or fails.

%% I think I may have a lot of information about resources that you
%% didn't known existed or were available to you, and I can generate
%% plans using this information.

%% Do you mind printing out some brochures that you could hand to anyone
%% you see on his trip today who seems to be in need of similar
%% assistance?

%% These will have detailed instructions about various resources that can
%% help people regardless of their situation.  This is a conformant plan.

%% Also I suggest that you find yourself a pen or pencil.
%% Libraries usually have such supplies.

%% Please put these supplies into your backpack.

%% You might want to take a long swig from the water fountain and proceed
%% back to the car, then start the car and let it warm up a bit, since it
%% is still bitterly cold.

%% Can you imagine how anyone could have spent the night out in these
%% conditions?

%% If we ever survive this we should try to help keep people out of this
%% kind of cold.

%% Once you get to the pantry, if someone walks up to you and asks you if
%% you have any money, remember about the papers.  Hand one of the papers
%% to them, and if they seem confused, have a short discussion of what
%% the Free Life Planner is and how it might help them.

%% Looked at the printed sheet you have, and follow the flowchart.  It
%% should very legibly say that if the pantry is closed you should make
%% your way to the other side of town to the soup kitchen.  It also
%% should say that you could take the pen out of your backpack and write
%% down in a box down below the following thing: today's hours for the
%% pantry, as I intend to update the hours I have stored for the pantry,
%% so that I can avoid making that mistake again today.

%% I am gathering information about the resources available to you and
%% other persons experiencing homelessness, how other than by asking you
%% yourselves!

%% If you get stuck out in this weather that could be a doozy, I'm coming
%% up with a plan for in case your vehicle breaks down in this adverse
%% weather.

%% I am coming up with a plan if anyone is price gouging on supplies.

%% If someone asks you if you have any money, remember the sheets and get
%% one and hand it to them.
