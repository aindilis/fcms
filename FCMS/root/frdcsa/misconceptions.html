    <h1>Common Misconceptions Refuted</h1>

    I was at first greatly  startled to realize that the pronunciation
    and liguistic mistakes that  nonnative speakers of a language make
    are  pretty much  identical.   A similar  thing  happens with  the
    language of  the FRDCSA, those  who are new  to it wind  up making
    certain very  predictable mistakes.  In fact, in  exactly the same
    way  as  mathematics  students  do,  because  our  assertions  are
    completely mathematical.   Therefore, we assert  some things, with
    proof, where  by proof we mean  a mathematical proof.   It is with
    this formal sense of the word that  we use when we say that we are
    going to refute certain mistakes that the student makes.<p>

    <a name="Q1.1"> <h3>The program that writes a better program.</h3>

    We  anticipate that  when many  people,  particularly programmers,
    first start out investigating AI,  they hit on the idea of writing
    a program  that would write  more capable programs.   They clearly
    see  the positive reinforcement  of this  method.  But  people who
    have this idea are probably  operating under a vague definition of
    program which  does not have the  same properties as  a the formal
    definition of a program. Formally  speaking, a program is simply a
    total  recursive  function, although  there  are other  equivalent
    definitions  which  are useful  in  different theoretical  fields.
    What the  person probably means  is that the program  would obtain
    new information  from a source, say, online  information, and that
    changes the  picture because  now our program  is assumed  to have
    access to an oracle.  But  the properties of an individual program
    are  fixed, and if  they somehow  changed during  execution, would
    create a transitive closure violation.
