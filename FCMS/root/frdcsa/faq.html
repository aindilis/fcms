<h3>Q</h3>

What sort of solutions are we looking to create, for what sort of
problems?<p>

<h3>A</h3>

There are a few central aims of our project.  Since we hold the belief
that software must be reused, and  that key to this reuse is a central
package repository, we aim to solve the problems necessary to:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Comprehensive Software Ontology (CSO).</li>
  <li>Compile as many packages  for software whose licenses permit and
as we have  the resources to, using automatic  packaging tools we have
written that  learn from our  experiences in packaging novel  types of
applications.</li>
 <li>Find or create  software which helps the user  to locate the right
tools     for      a     particular     job.       A     simple     <a
href="example.html">example</a></li>
</ol>

<p>

How  do we  limit which  types  of problems  we aim  to solve?   Well,
eventually  we  would like  the  computer  to  define an  ontology  of
problems, and  be able to do  planning.  Until we  have such software,
however,  we  are  simply  using  our  intuitition.   Our  main  focus
currently is  recruiting the core group of  programmers and packagers,
since we feel that our purpose is well-defined but impractical without
a software  development team focused  on achieving the above  3 goals.
These goals simplify somewhat the actual nature of the problems, which
we cannot yet  summarise, so you might already  be thinking about some
of  the limitations  of the  above 3  goals.  Check  out  our internal
codebases to  get a  better picture of  the state of  our approach.<p>

<h3>Q</h3>Who all's involved?<p>
<h3>A</h3>

The project  was initiated by  a socially disabled college  student in
his  first year  of college,  and has  been in  progress for  5 years,
developing the  theory and  the central goals  of the project.   It is
based  on results in  mathematical logic,  recursion theory  and proof
theory.<p>

Having defined the goals adequately,  a core group of individuals with
a largely altruistic interest was recruited.  However this took longer
than expected due to said social disability.<p>

The  core  team  now  consists   of  a  group  of  4  highly  creative
individuals.  However, luckily, there are  about 30 people in the area
who have  expressed serious interest  in participation when  the group
has become more established.   Therefore, we are working on recruiting
primary  members who  are  of  exceptional value  to  the group  right
now.<p>

There are about 100 people in  the area who have expressed an interest
in certain aspects of the project which are of mutual interest.<p>

Lastly, once we are organized we will see what kind of interest exists
in the online community.<p>

<h3>Q</h3>What sort of resources do we have to work with?<p>

<h3>A</h3>

We  have  two  primary   types  of  resources,  physical  and  mental.
Mentally, our  primary resource is  the theoretical framework  and the
shared  goals of  our group,  which will  see us  through  the initial
physical adversity during the difficult recruiting phase.<p>

As  far as  resources  go, we  have  not raised  money yet,  prefering
instead to fund  the project from small business.   We have a software
product we will sell shortly to  raise more money, and we are pursuing
fundraising opportunities for the project concurrently.<p>

We have  about 15 computers, 10  of which are XP  1800/512 DDR/120 GB.

<h3>Q</h3>What do we need to tackle short term?<p>

<h3>A</h3> Good  question.  We need  people who know what  to tackle
short term.   We have lots of  things.  Mainly we have  large lists of
relevant  tasks.  Without  a  doubt our  most  important objective  is
recruitment of  skilled members  for software development  and project
management.   On  the technical  side,  we  are  mainly interested  in
getting  our  software development  servers  up  to  speed.  From  the
nontechnical  side, we  are  interested  in creating  a  face for  our
organization.<p>

<a name="Q1.5">
<h3>Q</h3>What's the next step.<p>

<h3>A</h3>

Our next step is really  the recruitment of additional members who can
sort out the challenges and  find answers to these questions.  What we
offer is a  solution to certain problems and  the essential service of
packaging software for  a central repository in open  systems, since a
brief  look  around  illustrates   this  inadequacy.   Lastly  we  are
interested in  the fruits of  such a system  which we feel will,  as a
result of  the software glue we  write, and the  knowledge inherent in
the software we  package, will provide us with  better means to pursue
our  goals and  to  contribute  to free  operating  systems and  smart
computing platforms  that will help  society by literally  solving its
problems.<p> <p>

<h3>Q</h3>How is this project different than Sourceforge?.<p>

<h3>A</h3>

Good  question.    We  make  extensive  use  of   the  resources  that
Sourceforge  provides.  Sourceforge  is a  great repository  of online
software, but it  does not do certain things that  we need.  First, it
does not  actively locate software  by spidering the web,  rather, the
authors of software must register their product.  So, by spidering the
web  and  their resources,  we  can  actually  create a  comprehensive
software  ontology  that  includes  software  that  is  not  found  on
Sourceforge.  Secondly, it does  not always provide packages for their
software.<p> <p>

<h3>Q</h3>How is this project different than CPAN?.<p>

<h3>A</h3>

CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.  While many of interal
codebases  happen to  be written  in  Perl, the  majority of  external
codebases are not.  Our system  is also different from the main Debian
archive in  that our applications  have much lower  quality standards,
since we don't have the talent or man power of Debian.  However, we do
fill a role in that we make rough packages for end users, in the hopes
that we can help them to solve their problems.  In this way, users are
more likely  to find  what they  are looking for  and not  to redouble
efforts, as this is wasteful to the world.<p>
