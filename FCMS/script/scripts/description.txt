The FRDCSA Project seeks to resolve any and all issues interfering
with the welfare of living beings by means of a straightforward
mathematical trick that suggests a methodology to build a series of
increasingly capable and hence increasingly complex A.I. systems.
Implemented as Free/Libre Software, it is available for use and
modification by anyone with the means to access or receive it, and can
be copied without any restriction onto any traditional computer
system.  Whereas a human might require a many years or even a lifetime
of study to become skilled in various arts and sciences which maintain
and improve life, a computer can be manufactured for a relatively
cheaper marginal cost, and expert software (once actually developed)
can be loaded onto it for almost zero marginal cost.  Thus it makes a
certain kind of sense to try develop this A.I. software to imbue
computers with the ability to resolve problems affecting living
beings.


Given the
proliferation of computer systems


FRDCSA is a project that mythically seeks to solve all problems.  

(a.k.a. Formalized Research Database: Cluster Study and Apply)
is a project that aims to create Free/Libre Open Source Friendly
Artificial Intelligence Social Services.  It is based on advanced
A.I. technology designed to eventually solve all mathematical
problems, which we believe interfere with the ability to provide
universal social services in the real world.
