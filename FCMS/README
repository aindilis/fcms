ShinyCMS
========

ShinyCMS is an open source CMS built in Perl using the Catalyst framework.

It is intended for use by web designers and web developers who want to keep 
a clear distinction between the markup they create and the content their 
clients can edit.

The following functionality is either present or in progress:

 * CMS pages and forms
 * User accounts, profiles and administration
 * Blog
 * Online shop
 * News/PR section
 * Newsletters (HTML mailshots)
 * Event listings
 * Forums
 * Polls

ShinyCMS is being actively developed to add more features.  Please consult 
the documentation for more details - particularly docs/Features and docs/TODO.
