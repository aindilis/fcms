ShinyCMS - Developer Notes
==========================

Some things to bear in mind if you are going to be hacking on ShinyCMS and 
contributing your changes back to the main project.


DATABASE CHANGES

Please do not hand-edit the ShinyCMS::Schema::Result::* modules.  They are 
generated using the bin/regenerate-db-modules script.  If you want to make 
changes to the database structure, make your changes using the tools supplied 
by your database provider (e.g. alter tables or insert new tables using the 
mysql command line interface) and then regenerate the modules using the 
supplied script.

Note that the schema.sql file in documents/database is documentation, not a 
development tool.  Keeping it up to date is encouraged, but modifying it does 
not achieve anything useful in and of itself.


TESTS

ShinyCMS has very poor test coverage.  If you would like to improve this, your 
contributions will be very gratefully received!  At minimum, please don't make 
it worse... if you add a new controller, add a minimal test file for it too.


GENERAL

If you remove functionality that other people are using, your changes are 
unlikely to be integrated back into the main project!  It's usually a good 
idea to speak to other users and developers on #shinycms on irc.freenode.net 
before you start making major changes to existing code.
